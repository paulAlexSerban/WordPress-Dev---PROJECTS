# Architecture Document and System Design for Log Processing App

## Overview

The application is designed to fetch logs from AWS S3, sort them by date, parse the CSV logs to JSON format, merge logs for each month into a single JSON file, and finally push the data into a Google Sheet. This architecture employs a microservices approach and is developed using Node.js.

## System Components

### Microservices

1. **Log Fetcher**
   - Responsible for fetching logs from the S3 bucket.
  
2. **Log Sorter**
   - Sorts the fetched logs by date.

3. **CSV to JSON Parser**
   - Converts the sorted logs from CSV to JSON format.

4. **Monthly Log Merger**
   - Merges logs for each month into a single JSON file.

5. **Google Sheets Updater**
   - Pushes the final JSON data to a Google Sheet.

### Data Stores

1. **AWS S3**
   - Initial storage for logs.

2. **Temporary JSON Store**
   - Temporarily stores the JSON logs for each month.

### Third-party services

1. **AWS SDK**
   - For interacting with AWS S3.

2. **Google Sheets API**
   - For updating Google Sheets.

    +---------+       +----------+       +----------------+       +------------------+       +-----------------+
    | AWS S3  |------>| Log      |------>| CSV to JSON    |------>| Monthly Log      |------>| Google Sheets    |
    | Bucket  |       | Fetcher  |       | Parser         |       | Merger           |       | Updater          |
    +---------+       +----------+       +----------------+       +------------------+       +-----------------+
```

## Communication

1. RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.
2. JSON as the data interchange format.

## Implementation Details

### Log Fetcher

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();
// Code to fetch logs from S3 bucket and send to Log Sorter.
```

### Log Sorter

```javascript
// Code to sort logs by date and send sorted logs to CSV to JSON Parser.
```

### CSV to JSON Parser

```javascript
const csvParse = require('csv-parse/lib/sync');
// Code to parse sorted CSV logs to JSON and send to Monthly Log Merger.
```

### Monthly Log Merger

```javascript
// Code to merge logs by month into a single JSON file and send to Google Sheets Updater.
```

### Google Sheets Updater

```javascript
const {google} = require('googleapis');
const sheets = google.sheets('v4');
// Code to push JSON data to Google Sheets.
```

## Scalability and Load Balancing

1. Each microservice can be horizontally scaled.
2. Load balancing can be done through Kubernetes or AWS ECS for distributing incoming requests.

## Security

1. Secure the communications between microservices using HTTPS.
2. Use IAM roles for secure AWS SDK operations.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Implement logging in each microservice for easier debugging and monitoring.
2. Use tools like AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.

## Conclusion

This architecture aims to modularize each component for easy management, scalability, and further enhancement. By adopting a microservices architecture, we ensure that each component can evolve independently.
